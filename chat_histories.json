These are your non-negotiables.\n*   **Time Blocking:** Allocate specific, uninterrupted blocks of time in your schedule for each priority. Treat these blocks like important meetings.\n*   **Batch Similar Tasks:** Group together similar activities (e.g., answering emails, making calls, administrative work) and do them in one go. This reduces context switching.\n*   **Schedule Breaks:** Plan short, deliberate breaks between tasks or time blocks. This prevents burnout and maintains focus.\n*   **Review and Adjust:** At the end of the day, spend 5 minutes reviewing what you accomplished and what needs to carry over. Use this to inform tomorrow's plan.\n\nStart by identifying those top 3 priorities for today."
